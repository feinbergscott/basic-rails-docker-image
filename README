BUILDING IMAGES:

docker build -t ubuntu:test_app . # Use this tag for workers-dockers
docker build -t test_app:web - < workers-dockers/web-dockerfile


 SETUP LB AND MONITORING:

- ./mngmt_setup.sh nginx
- ./mngmt_setup.sh monit  # You need to configure email credentials in monitrc to recieve action notifications.
Each new started container will be added under monitoring automatically and removed from it when you use Stop option. So if you want to stop
some worker manually use Monit to do this.

Basic monit commands:
monit status  # shows status of the processes and using resources
monit start/stop <process>  # to start/stop process
monit (un)monitor <process> # to stop/start monitoring for particular process

Please find more info about monit configuration at http://mmonit.com/monit/documentation/monit.html

 
 START WORKERS:

./start_worker.sh -w web -c 3 -p 3000 -r test_app  # In this case 3 workers totally will be running ib the system.


STOP ALL WORKERS:

./start_worker.sh -S  # to stop all running containers
./start_worker.sh -s web  # to stop running container of the specified type


DELETE CONTAINER:
./start_worker.sh -w clock -D  # This command will remove all containers of specified type from the system if no-one is running.


RELOAD CONTAINERS:
If you code-base is changesd you might need to rebuild running containers.
./start_worker.sh -w web -c2 -r new_platform  # This command will stop running containers, delete them from system, build and run a new one(s).
